PC's Command Line Calculator
============================

This is a calculator based entirely in the Command Line Interface. It is supposed to be a sort of test project for myself to help me learn Go. It is currently *severly* incomplete, and does not serve any useful functionality yet.

## Documentation

I don't have any documentation for this app, and I don't plan on adding any unless it somehow blows up. If you want to know how to operate this, use the built-in help command with the flag `-h`.

## Installing

I don't plan on releasing binaries for this project unless it becomes popular. You will have to build this program youself. I'll give you a quick summary of steps to build it yourself:
1. Have a working Go environment on your computer. Read up on installing Go [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Copy the project's code into whatever directory you desire on your machine.
3. `cd` into wherever you placed the code, and then run `go build`.
4. If all goes well, you should have a file called `CLI-Calc` (`CLI-Calc.exe` on Windows) in the same directory as the project's code.
5. After `cd`ing into the project's directory, run the program using `./CLI-Calc` from your favourite terminal on Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, BSD, ect...), or `./CLI-Calc.exe` in PowerShell on Windows.

Please note this program is currently only tested on arm64 macOS with Apple Silicon, so other platforms may not work as intended (especially Windows). Open an issue if this is the case.

## Contributing

This project is not open for contribution, so sorry if you wished to help out around here. You can help by starting an issue about bugs, errors, or very poorly-written code.

## Usage

Use this project for whatever the hell you want, no attribution needed, I don't care. ~~Not like anyone would want to use this trashy code for any real purpose other than laughing at...~~
